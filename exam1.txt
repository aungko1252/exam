Web Design Research
  - The three major areas you research need to address before you begin to plan and create are:
    1. How to develop a website that stands out
    2. How to identify your audience
    3. Which new website technology you should incorporate
  - To gather ideas to make your website stand out:
    - Explore other websites and identify those that impress you.
    - Describe what made the information easy to find.
    - List the reasons you would want to return.

Identify your audience:
- To identify and learn more about your website visitors:
  - Are visitors to your website members of your audience?
  - Did they find what they were looking for on your website?
  - Was there anything they did not like about your website?

Incorporate new web technology:
- To determine the merit of these new technologies as they appear, prompt several questions:
  - What specifically can this technology do to further the purpose of my website?
- Will it appeal to my audience?
- What will it cost to put it into action?

TOOLS FOR CREATING WEB PAGE

HTML defines a Web page through tags, or markups, codes that specify how text, graphic, and other elements display and where links lead. The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a specification that defines how information is transferred between a Web server and an outside source, such as a database. A CGI program manages the data exchange across the CGI. CGI programs perform different tasks and allow dynamic interaction, such as processing information submitted by users via a form.

JavaScript, VBScript, and Perl are popular scripting languages utilized to write CGI programs or scripts.

Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (Perl) is a third scripting language frequently utilized for creating CGI programs or scripts.

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that, through predefined or customized, self-defined tags, offers a designer greater freedom to arrange or present information than HTML.

Wireless Markup Language (WML) is used to design Web pages specifically for microbrowsers such as handheld computers, PDAs, cellular telephones, and pagers.
