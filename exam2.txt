Writing for the Web

- Accurate: When collecting content for a website, confirm its accuracy with reliable sources. Refer to respected subject experts, professional organizations, and trade journals.

- Easily Read: Members of the web audience often scan web pages quickly rather than taking the time to read every word. Make the information on web pages easy to scan.

- Understandable: Visitors will quickly understand the general idea behind the content on a web page. Write copy in an inverted pyramid style, which places the conclusion first.

- Comprehensive and Concise: A web publication should include approximately half the copy that a print publication would contain. The majority of web users prefer not to read long passages of text onscreen.

Basic Design Principles

Print and web publications both seek to convey a powerful message and leave a distinct impression.

- Balance and Proximity: Arrange web elements such as photographs, illustrations, and text symmetrically, which is centered or balanced. Proximity, or closeness, is strongly associated with balance. Place elements that have a relationship close to each other.

- Contrast and Focus: Contrast is a mix of elements to stimulate attention. Contrast can be achieved by means of text styles, color choices, size of elements, and more. Contrast also establishes focus, the center of interest or activity. A web page needs a focal point, which is a dominating segment of the web page.

- Unity: Web pages and websites need unity, or a sense of oneness or belonging, to create and maintain a visual identity. Especially important to businesses and organizations, visual identity must be constant.

Advantages of Web Publishing

- Timeliness: Compared with print, timely content can be delivered more efficiently and economically via web publishing. A print publication's content significantly determines how long the publication will be accurate, current, and valuable. The same is true for a web publication.

- Interactivity: Unlike print, a web page offers the unique opportunity to interact with the audience. To encourage interactivity with the audience, make it convenient and easy.

- Reduced Production Costs: Compared with print, web publishing is more cost-effective. In the print environment, finances limit the extent to which one can design publications. For example, as a print designer, staying within a budget can be a challenge.

- Economical, Rapid Distribution: Distributing information via the web instead of print can be significantly faster and less expensive. For instance, imagine that as a volunteer for a community hospital.
