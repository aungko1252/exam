Service Providers

An internet service provider (ISP) is a business that has a permanent internet connection and provides temporary connections to individuals and companies free or for a fee. Two types of ISPs are regional and national. A regional ISP usually provides access to the internet through one or more telephone numbers local to a specific geographic area. A national ISP is a large business that provides local telephone numbers in most major cities and towns nationwide.
